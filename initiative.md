Here are some possible extensions to consider:

- Add an image kernel, e.g., blur. See this website: http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/
- Given a text file of integers representing feet above sea level, make a topographical map. See this website: [Mountain Paths project](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2016/franke-mountain-paths/)
- Make an [Andy Warhol portrait](https://d2jv9003bew7ag.cloudfront.net/uploads/andy-warhol-marilyn1-865x577.jpg).
- Measure how different two images are from each other. Make or find a formula for determining differences between images.
- Run all your methods on a large data set and rank them fastest to slowest.
